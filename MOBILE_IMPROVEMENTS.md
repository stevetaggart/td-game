# Mobile Improvements for Tower Defense Game

## Overview
The tower defense game has been updated to be fully responsive and mobile-friendly. The game now automatically adapts to different screen sizes and provides an optimized experience for mobile devices.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Responsive Design

- **Mobile Layout**: Tower buttons and controls are rearranged for better mobile usability

### 3. Touch Controls
- **Touch Event Handling**: Added specific touch event handling for mobile devices
- **Touch-Friendly Targets**: Buttons meet minimum touch target size requirements (44px minimum)
- **Improved Interaction**: Touch interactions are optimized for mobile screens

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- **Responsive Scaling**: Game elements scale appropriately without performance loss
- **Mobile-Specific Configurations**: Different settings for mobile vs desktop
- **Efficient Rendering**: Optimized for mobile GPU capabilities
