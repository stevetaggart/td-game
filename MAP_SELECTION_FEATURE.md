# Map Selection Feature Implementation

## Overview
This PR adds a comprehensive map selection system to the tower defense game, allowing players to choose from multiple maps before starting the game and providing a way to return to map selection during gameplay.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Map Selection Scene (`src/map-selection-scene.js`)
- **Initial Game Screen**: When the game loads, players now see a map selection screen instead of immediately starting gameplay
- **Map Thumbnails**: Visual previews of each map showing the path layout
- **Map Information**: Each map displays:
  - Name and description
  - Difficulty level (color-coded: Easy=Green, Medium=Orange, Hard=Red, Expert=Purple)
  - Visual thumbnail with path preview
- **Interactive Selection**: Click to select a map, with visual feedback and highlighting
- **Play Button**: Disabled until a map is selected, then allows starting the game
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to mobile and desktop layouts

### 2. Multiple Maps (`src/maps-config.js`)
Four unique maps have been created:

#### Classic Route (Easy)
- The original tower defense path
- Straightforward layout, good for beginners

#### Serpentine Valley (Medium)  
- Winding snake-like path with multiple turns
- Moderate difficulty with strategic placement challenges

#### Spiral Fortress (Hard)
- Enemies spiral inward toward the center
- Challenging tower placement with limited space

#### Cross Roads (Expert)
- Complex path with multiple junctions and direction changes
- Most challenging map requiring advanced strategy

### 3. Dynamic Path System
- **PathManager Updated**: Now loads the selected map's path instead of hardcoded path
- **Responsive Scaling**: All map paths scale properly for different screen sizes
- **Asset Loading**: Game loads the correct background SVG for each map

### 4. Return to Map Selection
- **Map Selection Button**: Added to the game UI (top-right area)
- **Responsive Button**: Shows "Maps" on mobile, "Select Map" on desktop
- **Easy Navigation**: Players can return to map selection at any time during gameplay

### 5. Visual Assets
Created SVG files for each map:
- `assets/maps/serpentine_path.svg` - Winding path with teal accents
- `assets/maps/spiral_path.svg` - Spiral path with purple theme
- `assets/maps/crossroads_path.svg` - Complex intersecting paths with purple theme

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified/Created:
1. **New Files:**
   - `src/maps-config.js` - Map definitions and utilities
   - `src/map-selection-scene.js` - Map selection scene
   - `assets/maps/serpentine_path.svg` - Serpentine map visual
   - `assets/maps/spiral_path.svg` - Spiral map visual  
   - `assets/maps/crossroads_path.svg` - Crossroads map visual

2. **Modified Files:**
   - `src/game-init.js` - Added MapSelectionScene to scene array and resize handling
   - `src/game-systems.js` - Updated PathManager to use selected map
   - `src/tower_defense_game.js` - Load map-specific background assets
   - `src/ui-manager.js` - Added map selection button
   - `index.html` - Added new script includes

### Key Classes and Functions:
- `MapSelectionScene` - Main scene for map selection
- `MapsConfig` - Map definitions and configuration
- `MapUtils` - Utility functions for map operations
- `PathManager.constructor()` - Updated to use selected map
- `UIManager.createMapSelectionButton()` - New map selection button

## User Experience Flow

1. **Game Launch**: Player sees map selection screen with 4 map options
2. **Map Selection**: Player clicks on a map to select it (visual feedback provided)
3. **Start Game**: "Play Selected Map" button becomes enabled
4. **Gameplay**: Game loads with selected map's path and background
5. **Return Option**: Player can click "Select Map" button to return to selection screen

## Mobile Compatibility
- Touch-friendly map selection cards
- Responsive layout (1 column on mobile, 2 columns on desktop)
- Haptic feedback on mobile devices
- Optimized button sizes and spacing

## Technical Benefits
- **Modular Design**: Easy to add new maps by adding entries to MapsConfig
- **Scalable**: Path system works with any screen size
- **Maintainable**: Clean separation between map data and game logic
- **Extensible**: Foundation for future features like map unlocking, ratings, etc.

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test map selection on various screen sizes
2. Verify all maps load correctly with proper paths
3. Ensure return-to-selection functionality works during gameplay
4. Test touch interactions on mobile devices
5. Verify map thumbnails generate correctly

## Future Enhancements
- Add map preview mode to explore paths before selection
- Implement map unlocking system based on player progress
- Add map ratings/difficulty indicators
- Create procedurally generated maps
- Add map editor functionality
